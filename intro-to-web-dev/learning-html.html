  <p>IDs are far less useful than classes. Whereas you'll be using classes everywhere and frequently, you should be
    using IDs very sparingly. As you see in our above blog-posts HTML, we can re-use classes like post and post-title.
    This is extremely important. As a coder, you want a piece of code and use it a lot. As coders, we want to write as
    little code as possible (which we'll explore why later, for now trust me.) For now, be satisfied that I get to write
    a little bit of code that governs post and have it affect every post on the page.</p>

  <p>Let's contrast that with IDs. When you designate something with an ID, you're affirming that this is the only one
    of those on your website. Not even just that page, but your whole website. Sometimes that is useful; just not very
    often. Some other coders and tutorials will tell you to never use IDs; I think that's misguided. IDs are a
    sledgehammer. Most problems don't require a sledgehammer. However sometimes you have problems that need a
    sledgehammer and then you're really grateful that you have one.</p>
