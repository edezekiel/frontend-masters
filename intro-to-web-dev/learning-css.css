/* Don't style on tags! Style on classes. 
UNLESS it's a global style across the site.*/

/* So what should you use, generally speaking. Classes. Almost always classes. 
This is the consensus in the front end development community. Classes are the 
best way to style web pages. There are rare occasions that it may be useful 
style on tags (like if you literally want to style every a tag on the page) but 
those cases are rare. Use classes. Err on the side of using classes too much. */
